# Homework(1/1)
## 1、According to the von Neumann architecture, List basic parts of a computer.
CPU 显示屏 鼠标 内存 显卡 键盘 光驱 主板 硬盘

## 2、A computer has 64 MB (megabytes) of memory. How many bits are needed to address any single byte in memory?
64MB=64*(2^10)(2^10)B=2^26 B
ln(2^26)/ln(2)=26
所以至少需要26个地址线

## 3、List basic parts of a CPU, include cache or not?
运算器 控制器 存储器，包括

## 4、What mean secondary storage. List some on your PC.
is a non-volatile memory (does not lose stored data when the device is powered down) that is not directly accessible by the CPU, because it is not accessed via the input/output channels (it is an external device). In RAM devices (as flash memory) data can be directly deleted or changed.

硬盘，磁盘，存储卡

## 5、使用维基百科，解释以下概念：CPU、RAM、ROM、Bus (computing)、Parallel Computing

### CPU
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. 

### RAM
Random-access memory is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. 

### ROM
Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.

### Bus
In computer architecture, a bus(a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.

### Parallel Computing
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling.As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.

## 6、写一段文字，简单解释“云计算（cloud computing）”
    计算机用户不需要单独处理和管理需要的网络元素，而通过一个由多个提供商管理的硬件和软件套件形成的共享池来达到目的。这是一种成本更低、安全性更高的数据处理和管理方法。

## 7、小孙买了计算机主板，说明书表明“支持双通道DDR3-1333内存，最大支持16G”
### 1）DDR3内存，“3”和“1333”的含义是什么？
“3”是指双数据速率类型d三代，“1333”指内存的工作频率
### 2）小孙买8G DDR3-1600的内存能提高性能吗？
不可以，主板支持1333频率的内存，即使提高到1600也不能提高性能
### 3）小孙买4G*2 DDR3-1333的内存能提高性能吗？
可以，双通道可以大幅提升内存工作效率
### 4）16G需要多少位地址？
