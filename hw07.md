# Homework(1/1)
## 1、Program with machine language according to the following c.
int_8 a = 1; <br/>
int_8 c = a + 3;<br/>

### 1）Write your assembly code & machine code.
LOD #1<br/>
STO A<br/>
LOD A<br/>
ADD #3<br/>
STO C<br/>
HLT<br/>
### 2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle
Fetch the next instruction<br/>
Decode the instruction<br/>
Get data if needed<br/>
Execute the instruction<br/>
### 3）Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU
IR:在计算中，指令寄存器（IR）是一个部分CPU的控制单元，其保持当前正在执行或解码该指令。在简单处理器中，每个要执行的指令被加载到指令寄存器中，该指令寄存器在解码，准备并最终执行时保持它，这可能需要几个步骤。<br/>
PC:PC在获取指令后递增，并保持（“ 指向 ”）下一条指令的存储器地址。<br/>
ACC:累加寄存器，功能是当运算器的算术逻辑单元(ALU)执行全部算术和逻辑运算时，为ALU提供一个工作区，暂时存放ALU运算结果<br/>
### 4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine

## 2、简答题
### 1）What are stored in memory?
指令和数据
### 2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?
可以
### 3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.
以00000000 00000001为例
前八位为命令指示,第四位确定寻址模式，0代表操作数是该地址的内容,五到八位是操作码，0000代表ADD.后八位表示操作数。这个指令代表加上将内存地址为1中的数据

## 3、解释以下词汇
### 1）汇编语言（Assembly Language）
An assembly (or assembler) language,     often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.

### 2）编译（Compiler）
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

### 3）命令式语言（Imperative programming）
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

### 4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.


### 5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.
